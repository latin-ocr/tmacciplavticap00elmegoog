PREFACE.

Tun text of the present edition of the Captivi may by
some, perhaps, be considered nltraconservative„ 1 still
hold, and more firmly than ever, the view expressed in my
edition of the Phcmaio of Terence, that the testimony of
the manuscripts is invariably entitled to more consideration
than arbitrary “ corrections.'' Again and again has it been
demonstrated that manuscript readings, which to cur imper-
fect visicn seemed impossible, ¹represent after all what was
originally written in ancient texts. Even while the present
volume is in preparation, there appears in the Rheiairchea
Marcoman article by Birt, wherein he makes it seem proba
ble that scores cf manuscript readings in Plautus which
editors have considered certainly corrupt, and which most ¹
cf them have taken it upon themselves to “emend'' are
correct as they stand. Many other supposedly corrupt
manuscript readings in Plautus have, during the last few
years, been vindicated by the work of Leo, Skutsch, and
other investigators. When cnr fallibility of judgment on
such matters is being demonstrated airesh, even as we gc
to press with our new editione, does it not become ns to
treet the text with the utmost cantion and το cherish an
increasing respect for manuscript traditions? In establish-
ing the text I bave been guided by the principle that, before
an editor is justified in introducing any conjecture unsup
ported by ancient testimony, the following conditions must

exist: (1) it must be positively proved by careful investi·
