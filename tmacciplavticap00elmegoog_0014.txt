gation that the ancient testimony, if any exists, cannot
possibly be correct; (2) the conjecture must have been  
sanctioned by the consensus 01 all competent critics. Until
these requirements are met, all conjectures should he con-
fined to critical notes. Itis better to leave a passage unin-
telligible, with 1110 certain imprint of the centuries upon it,
than, at the risk of continuing the work of the corrupting
hands that have wrought before us, to introduce mere con-
jectures that are not of such a nature as to command general
acceptance. While, therefore, I believe Ι have duly consid·
cred all the important suggestions that have been made in
recent years so far as they bear upon the text of the Ocptici,
and while 1 have mentioned many 01 these in my critical
notes, Ι have introduced but few of them into my text.
Such textual criticism as I have allowed myself to indulge
in has been systematically excluded from the main com-
mentary and relegated to an Appendix, which is also util-
ized for the citation of authorities for statements made in
my notes, where such citation secmed desirable.

In preparing 1110 book I have had access to all impor-
tant editions of the 0001101, but 1 have consulted most
frequently those of Brix-Niemeyer‚ Goetz and SchoelL Hal-
lidie‚ Leo, ,Lindsay, Mortis, and Sonnenschein. To all of
these I hereby acknowledge my indebtedness 101 valuable
help. I am further indebted to Messrs. B. H. Sanborn&
Co. for their courtesy in allowing me to embody in the
present volume a few peges from the Introduction to my
edition of the Phormio, of which they arethe publishers.

I must also express to Professor Ε. W. fay, of the Uni-
versity 01 Terras, Professor Gonzalcz Lodge, of Bryn Mawr
College, and Professor J. O. nolle, of the University of
Michigan, my gratitude for their kindness and generosity
