ters, such as bragging soldiers, sponging parasitos, and inso
lent sycophants, are held up to ridicule. As compensation
101 this narrower range 01 subjecte, appears invention 01 new
situations and 01 amusing complications out 01 which the
same ever-recurring characters have to extricata themselves.
In tlris respect the ¹fruitful, untiring genius 01 the poets 01
the new eomedy challenges our admiration, though our esti-
mato 01 them is based upon mere fragments from their plays
and upon Latin plays that are modelled after them.

’ Among the poets 01 the new Attio comedy, 01 whom there
were more than sixty, the most distinguished in the judgrnent
01 antiquity was Menander (342-290 ao). Next to him,
Philemon, Diphilus, Philippides, Posidippus, and Apollodorum
01 Carystus are to he named as the favorite writers 01
comedy. Oi the original productioris 01 these poets only a
few fragments have come down to· us. We have, however,

’ Latin adaptations from some 01 their plays in the two great

comio poets 01 Rome, Plautus and Terence.

Oi course the transition from theold to the new comedy
was a gradual one. It extended over a period 01 fifty years,
110111 the Plutus 01 Aristophanes (presented first 111408 and
again—this time in a revised form and without chorus and
parabasis'-in 388) to about the time oi the Macedonian
sovereignty (338). The best known poets 01 this period are
Antiphanes and Alexis. Whether we should look upon this
secalled middle comedy as forming a distinct type by itseli

may be questioned3 but at any rate the division into the ⁴

old and the new is an important one, and each 01 these two
classes is marked by well-defined characteristics.

The new comedy, in its development, coincides with the
politica] decline 01 Greece and with the gradual deoay 01
1101 art. As compared with the old comedy, it shows in
many respects unmistakable retrogression. As a natural
result, however, 01 the conditions already indicated, it is free
from that distinotly local coloring, which makes even a play
