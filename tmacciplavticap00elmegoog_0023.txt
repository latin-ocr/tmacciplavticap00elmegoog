fabulae palliatae, from the Greek cloak (pallium) worn by
the actore, to distinguish them from the fabmnamgatae in
which Roman manners were represented. The first writer
to he mentioned in this connection is Anicius Andronicus, who
was born at Tarentum about 284 ao. After the capture of
his native city 111272 no, he became the slave of M. Livius ·
Salinator, who, charmed hythe talents of the young man,
soon afterwards gave him his freedom. In 240 Livius was
engaged to produce, as one of the attractions of the ludi
Borcani, two Latin plays, a tragedy and a comedy, adapted
from Greek originals. Such dramatic entertainments had
*for a long time been regularly given in the original Greek
in the towns of southern Italy, and so were more or less
familiar to the Romans. These performances found such
favor at Rome that from this time on they became a regular
part of the gamos. Livius Andronicus must then be looked
upon as having introduced a new era for the Roman stage.
In Livy the historiar (7. 2),Ι the existence of a connected
plot and the systematic arrangement of the contente are
designated as the features that distinguished the new drama
irem the old satura. It was further distinguished by the
employment of Greek metres and by differences in the form
of representation. Only a few fragments of the plays of
Livius have cerne down to us. We know, however, that he
was held in so great esteem at Rome that, in honor of him,
the temple of Minerva on the Aventine was appropriated to
the use of scribae et histriones, who organized themselves
into a sort of poets' guild.

6. Another-writer, likewise active in both tragedy and
comedy, was cn. Naevius, a native of Campania, born about
265 no. Being a Latin by descent, he took part in the
First Punic War, a conflict which he afterward described
in Saturnian verse. After 235 no. we find him noted at
Rome as a fiery and popular poet, especially in the field of

. comedy. Fragments oi thirty of his eomedies have come
