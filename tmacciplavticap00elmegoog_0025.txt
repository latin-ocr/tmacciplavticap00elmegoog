HIS‘l'ORY OF auam( AND ROMAN COMEDY, IV

10 bring the old again and again upon the stage (see p. xx), ι
the comediee 01 Plautus long continued to be among the
chief attractione 01 the theatre. So great indeed was 1110
popularity that plays 01 other writers were frequently given
out under his 1101110, 111 the hope 01 insuring 101 1110111 amore
cordial welcome. That 110 was fully conscious 01 the hold
he had upon the sympathies 01 the people is shown by the
epitaph, still preserved, which he himself wrote 1011110 own
tomb. It is as follows:-

Postquam 001 mortem aptus Plautus, comoedia luget
Scaena est deserta ac dein risus, ludus iocusque
Ilt numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt.

(After Plautus succumbed to death, Comedy put on mouming, the ’
stage was 1011 unoccupied‚ then Laughter‚ Mirth‚ and Merriment‚ and
Verses numberless, all with one accord burst into tears.) ⁷

01 Varro that twenty-one 01 these plays were admitted by
