been genuine productions 01 Plautus, but most 01 them ,
were undoubtedly the works 01 some inferior poet or poets.
While all 01 the twenty plays preserved to, us are schalae
palliatae, Plautus treated his Greek originale with consid·
erable freedom, and never hesitated to introduce distinotly
Roman allusione, and tc recast in a mould 01 his own the
material offered him by his original, wherever he thought
that by such recasting he could add to the humor or interest
01 the play. For the points 01 contrast between Plautus
and Terence, in this and other respeots, see p. xix ff. As
already indicated, the popularity 01 Plautus among his con·
temporaries was unrivalled. On the subsequent history
01 his plays, and the judgment 01 posterity regarding them,
see Chapter II., below, p. xx.

9. Q. Ennius is chiefly noted 1011110 epio poem called
Annales—in which he related, in eighteen books, the entire

history 01 Rome 110111 the earliest times down to his own, - ’

comedy, and so deserves mention here. He was bornat
Rudiae in Calabria, in 2311110. In 204 he was brought
by the quaestor M. Porcius 0010110111 Sardinia to Rome,
where he seems to have lived iu moderate circumstances as
teacher 01 Greek and as stage poet. In 184 110. he received ¹
the right 01 Roman citizenship, which he lived to enjoy for
fifteen years. None 01 his ccmedies have come down to us
-not even in fragments 01 any importanoe.

10. The next poet worthy 01 mention in this connection
is statius Caecilius, who enjoyed an enviable reputation
among the ancients as a writer 01 palliatae, and who was an
important forerunner 01 Terence. An Insubrian by birth,
he came to Rome about194 aa, probably as a captive
taken 111 war. Later, however, he was given his freedom.
His first attempt at comedy failed, and was'not even heard
to the end by the impatient audience3 but he toiled on till
he won literary fame and a name among comio poets second
