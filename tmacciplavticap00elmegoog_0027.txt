only, as yet, to that of Plautus. He died soon after
Ennius, with whom in 1111 he had been on the most inti·
mate terme. -
11. Publius Terentius Ater was born 11 Carthage, about
, 190 acl At 111 early age, he came to Rome as 1 slave 01
the senator Terentius Lucanus. His master, struck'by the
1111111 and the prepossessing appearance 01 the boy, not Α
only caused him to be carefully edueated, but also gave him
-his freedom. The associatione to which he had been accus
tomed in the house of his master made it easy 101 him to
lreep up his connectione with the nobility 01 Rome, aud cer·
tain prominent members 01 this nobility became his firm
friends. Chief among these were Scipio Africanus (the l
younger), C. Laelius, and L. Furius Philus. '
12. The literary tendeney of the times, as well as his
own inclination, led the poet to devote his activity to
the fabulo palliola. Terence produced his first comedy,
the Andria, at the lndi Megalenses, in April, 166 ne. The
aediles, who had charge 01 the games, had some misgivings
about allowing the presentation 01 1 play by arg entirely
unknown poet. He was accordingly induced to submit his
⁰ play first to the older poet Caecilius, 101 approval. Regard-
· ⁴ing the meeting between these two poets, the following,
story is told Terence found Caecilius at dinner, and, as
the caller was meanly dressed, he was given a seat on 1
· bench near the couch on which the great author was reclin-
ing, and was then given permission to read what he had
ι written. After the first few verses had been read, Caecilius
was so captivated by the young men's talents that he in-
’ vited him to 1 place beside him upon the couch. He then
listened attentively and with unbounded admiration to the
remainder 11 the play.

1Τ111 dete generally given 11185, in accordance with Suetonius, in
hiscite Terenti ,· but Η. Sauppe (Ncelr. d. (11111. pes, 1870, pp. 111 ff.)
has made this date seem very improbable.
