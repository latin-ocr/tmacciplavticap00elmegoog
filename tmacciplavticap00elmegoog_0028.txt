14. It is not to be wondered at that the earliest writers,
in adapting the productione of foreign genius to Roman ears,
should give them something of a native character, and we
accordingly find that all the plays of Plautus bear Latin
titles (Artoarta, Aulularia, Gapaloi, eta), except in plays
like the Amphitruo and the Epidicus, where the title is taken
from the Greek name oi a person in the play. Attention
has already been called to the fact that the plays oi Plautus
abeund in Roman allusione. Later, however, as the influ-
enoe of Greek culture came to be more widespread, there
was an ever-increasing tendency to make the Latin plays
more nearly like the Greek from which the plots were taken. '

adversary, Luscius Lanuvinus, made it a point of attach that
he sometimes departed so iar from his Greek original as to
weave into the general plot of his drama such soenes from
other Greek comedies as particularly struck his fancy. This
process of ⁴combining parts of 'different plays into one 'was
