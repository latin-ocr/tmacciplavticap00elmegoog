newertheless, abundant creative fancy, and frequently startles
one with elever originalities. Terence is satisfied with fidel-
ity tc his Greek model, departing tramit rarely‚ and only
when he feels that his artistic purpose requires it. Plautus

trasts. Terence aims at truth, accuracy, and artistic finish
The style of Plautus ¹is reckless and extravagant, of the do
all and dareall sort, and his words are often imparted from
the Greek or manufactured to suit the occasion. The style
of Terence is more sober and sedate, and his words are
those sanctioned by good Latin usage. Plautus can inflict

Nunquameripides (Pers, 702); Terence would consider
such word-making beneath his dignity. Plautus aimed at
making fun, sacrificing or subordinating ererything to
this one purpose; Terence aimed at drawing a true picture
of Greek life in the purest‘collcquial Latin, so iar, at any
rate, as Greek life was correctly pcrtrayed in the poets from
whom he drew his material. In general, the excellences of

Plautus are largely such as depend upon spontaneity of ⁸

genius; those of Terence are the result of thought and
study and peinstaking in reproducing‚ in the most artistic
form, the excellentes of his Greek models.
