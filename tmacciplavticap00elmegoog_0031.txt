HISTORY OF THE ΤΕΧΤ OF PLAUTUS. xxi

them better suited to the altered conditions under which

for such purposes. His plays continued to be put on the
stage for a long time aiter the poet’s death, and there can
be no doubt that they ars preserved to us in the form which
they received to fit them for these later reproductions. Some
of the prologum now prefixed to the plays may have¹ been

aorortlo arguments, or metrical summaries, prefixed to all the
plays of Plautus except the Bacchides. For the non-acrosflo
arguments, which belong to a later period, see p. xxiii. As
early as the second half of the second century rac, scholare
began, in imitation and emulation of the Greek grammarians,
to turn their attention to the study of schidae palliatae. The
texts of the comedians were brought together in suitable
form for reading, special care being taken to preserve, as
