all quartem, of the scattered and neglected plays of Rome's
greatest comedian, Plautus. At any rate, some such col-
lection must have been made by some one at about this
time There is, however, no reason to suppose that it
consisted only of the. twentyone plays now assigned to
Plautus. It is probable that other plays were extant and
were included in the collection, and that another gram-
marian published a critical edition of twentyone of these
plays, including in this corpus only such aa Varro had said

genuine productione of Plautus. After publication, such an
edition must have become the basis of all Plautina study,
an assumption which accounts for-the fact that all the other

It should be noticed, however, that 'the corruptions dating
from this period are chiefly due to a lively interest in the
plays, while the earlier corruptions above referred to (p. xxii)
were duo to carelessness and neglect.

play of erudition, and a popular field for such display was
that offered by archalc Latin. Great zeal was shown in the

is possible that the non-aorootlc¹ arguments (see p. xxi) were
written by this critic. Plautus was, however, doomed to
be forgotten again. In the Middle Ages he seems to have
been practically unknown. Hrotswitha von Gandersheim,
an imitator of Terence, who flourished in the latter half of
the tenth century, knows nothing of him. At the beginning
of the fifteenth century all but eight of the plays were still
