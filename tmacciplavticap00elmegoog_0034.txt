unknown. These eight were Amphitrite, Asinaria, Aulula
ria, Captivi, Curculio, Oaslaa, Cistellaria, and Epidiars, and
these are preserved in a large number of extant manu-
scripts, dating from the fourteenth and fifteenth‘centuries.
A manuscript (D), containing some oi these eight plays and
also the remaining twelve, was found in Germany about
1428, and isi now in the Vatican at Roma It dates from

the twelfth century. The oldest manuscript (A) of Plautus
now extant, and indeed one cf the oldest Latin manuscripts
preserved to us, was discovered by' Cardinal Mai in 1815, in
the Ambrosiam library at Milan, and is known as the Ambra
siaa palimpsest. It was written in the fourth or fifth century,
and is 01 course of great importance in establishing the text,
= though it lacks the Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, and Oar-
00110 entirely, and preserves the other plays in a more or less
incompleta lorm‘. Two other manuscripts (B and C) were Α
used by Camerarius in the sixteenth century, one of these
(B, of the eleventh century) containing all of the twenty

’ plays, the other (of the twelfth century) only the last twelve.

A collation oi a very important manuscript-viz. the one
used by Turnebus, a famous French scholar of the sixteenth
century -sshas recently been discovered by Lindsay.¹

22. Somewhat more than forty years aiter the discovery
oi the manuscript containing the twelve lost plays, ap
peared the first complete printed edition of Plautus,² that·
of Georgius Merula, published in Venice in 1472. From

· that'time 011 there was an almost constant ¹succession ol

editions oi either a part or the whole of Plautus, until
toward the end oi the seventeenth century. Thea inter-
est in Plautine studies again died out and during the

lSonnenschein, however (Closs. Rev. for May, 1899), expresses
doubt as to whether Lindsay’s discovery really represents the read-
ings ol the codes Taroebi.

2Therc was. however, a somewhat earlier edition Ι01 the other
eight plays.
