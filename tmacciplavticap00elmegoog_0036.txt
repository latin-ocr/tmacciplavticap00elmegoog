from their own private means. Besides the games that were
thus celebrated on behalf of the state, there were also others
given on extraordinary occasions, viz. ludi funebres (or suae
uoles), in honor of celebrated men, those accompanying dedi·
cations and triumphs, and those given as votive offerings.
24. Down to 174 rac( the mamutio performanoes took
place near the temple of the deity chiefly concerne'd in the
festivities.¹ Permanent theatres of stone, such as were later
built on ascale of great grandeur, were as yet unknown. .
When a play was tc baproduced, a wooden stage was erected
for the purpose, and then taken down after the performance.
This stage was ordinarily built near the foot of some hill,
or slope, so that the rising ground might afford convenient
scats for the spectators, while those in frent would not
obstruet the view of those in the rear. On such a slope the
people assembled under the open sky. As no seats were
provided for their accommodation, they usually sat, or
reclined, upon the ground. The more fastidious sometimes
had stools brought lor them from their homes, although
this was looked upon as a mark of effeminacy and was
even forbidden. ln 179 no, a stage of stone was erected
near the temple of Apollo, but this was of small dimensions
and was probably intended for use only at the ludi Apolli-
nares. Five years later, arrangements were made, on the
part of the state, for the building of a substantial, per-0
manent stage,2 but this, if it was actually built, seems ’
soon tc have disappeared. 111146 no, L. Mummius built
a complete theatro, provided with rows of scats, but this
was of wood, and was taken down after each performancc.
Finally, in 55 no, was dedicated the stone theatre of Cn.
Pompeius, the first permanent theatro erected in Rome. It

lFuneral garnes (perhaps also the ludi Romani) took place in the

lorum. That the ludi Apollinares at least, in the beginning, were .

given in the Circus Maximus, is clear from Liv. 25. 12, 14.
