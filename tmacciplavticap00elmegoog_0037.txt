25. The dramatic performances usually took place between

' prandium (about twelve o'clock) and cenc(after three o'clock),

sc that when we consider the other amusements that formed ,
apert of the day's exercises, it seems hardly possible that

· more than one play could, as a rule, have been presented

on any one day. Later, in Cicero’s time, the cnstom of
giving these performances in the early morning was intro
duced.

26. When a play was to be given, the fact was announced
by a crier (praeeo), that the people might assemble at the
proper plane. Immediately before the performance began,
there was a tituli pronuntiatio, an announcement of the sub
ject of, the play3 but sometimes the prologus itself conveyed
to the andienoe their first information regarding the subject
of the play' and the name of the poet. The antors were
slaves, or, in later times, freedmen, this profession being
considered beneath the 'dignity of free-born men. The
minus, or general manager of the troupe was a freedman,¹
who also took part in the acting and was sometimes called
the actor (ie. pon excellence). At first, poets were wont to .
bring out their plays themselves, hiring slaves and freed·
men for the purpose, but this practice ceased at an early
date, and, as early as Plautus, the poet himself· was no
longer oeten also. The Stichus of Plautus, for instance,
according to the didascalia, was brought out by T. Publilius ,
Pellio, who is severely criticised by the poet vhimself (Bucen
214 f.) for the manner in which he put the Epidicus on the
stage.

2⁷. To the theatrical managers (donini) application was
made by those who wished to give dramatic entertainments.
