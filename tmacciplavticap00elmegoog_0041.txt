iambio, trochaic,'and anapaestic verses is that they are, at

feet, instead of by single feet, each dipody having one main
and one subordinate ictus. Accordingly, averse of four
feet is called a dimeter (instead of a tetrameter), one of six
feet a trimeter (instead ol a hexameter), etc. Frequently,
however, 'and especially with reference to early Latin
poetry, these verses are called quaternarii, senarii, etc,
names given them solely with reference to the number of
feet contained in each, the distinctions between the odd
and the even feet having been, for the most part, lost sight
of by early Latin poete.

many difficulties. Even in the time of Cicero the most
common and least difficult of these metros-namely the
