all. The semeis true of all the early editions prior tc that
of Pylades (1506). It is only during the present century
that most of the laws governing these early matres have
been discovered. Even yet‘ many difficulties remain, and it
is frequently impossible tc determine definitely the char·
aeter of individual verses or the points at which verse-
division should be made. In the Captivi, for instance, ἱ
there arc twenty verses (212, 232-234, lev-515, 836) which
the recent critical edition of Goetz and Sohoell makes no
attempt to assign to definite metros. On account of the

the time of Bentley, been customary for each editor tc
mark the main, or primary, ictuses in each verse, in order
to indicate what seems tc him individually, or to editors
generally, the proper scansion.

of a foot. (See, however, note on p. xlv.)

(c) merab, that sort of division (within averse) which is
caused by the coincidence of the end of a word with
the end of a foot, eg. in the verse-

hc salutm scrutate aaut Ι nuperos ι tu repertae,

there is diaeresis after vacuit and again after Hesperus.
(d) mann, the coming together cf two vowels (each with
its own natural quantity), caused by the nonelision
of a final vowel ‘before a word beginning with a
vowel or lv (but see Intrcd. § 74).
(e) semi-hiatus, the occurrence of a final lory vowel, cra
diphthong, before a word beginning with a vowel cr
