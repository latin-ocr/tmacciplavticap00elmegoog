xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

· 40. lambio senarius (Trimeter Acatalecflc). -The cae-
suras may be classified as follows, in the order of their
frequency: (a) the sccalled penthemimeral, after the ⁴
arsis of the third foot, e.g.¹ oEoLollioLoAcd,
(b) the hepthemimeral, after the arsis of the fourth foot,
ag. chLoAclLoAEcd, in which case there is
often diaeresis after, or a secondary caesura in, the secend
foot.

41. In connection with this verse, the following peculiar-
ities call for notice: (1) an anapaest is⁰seldom allowed
immediately after a dactyl, or a tribrach3 (2) when a
proceleusmatic is used, its ictussyllable nearly always
begins a word, and the ictus and word-accent, with rare
exceptione, coincide. The proceleusmatic is most common
in the first scot, it is rare in the fifth foot. ’

42. N early all the plays of Plautus open with cambio
macrii. This is the verse of ordinary narrative or dia
logue, sometimes also of soliloquy, and seems the one
best adapted for making the audience acquainted with
the general situation. Its movement may be illustrated
hy the following lines: -

“ The temneat neers us 3 daikly rolls the angry sea;
The thunder mutters3 lightnings leap from cloud to cloud.‘’

As the plot develops, the metra changes to suit the varying
moods of the characters.

43. lambio octonarius (Tetrameter Acatalectlc). -The .
caesura of this werse falls into two classes: (a) It
may be after the fifth arsis, ie. o - o L υ A o L o ΙΙ
ΖΛ o L o A o L, (b) it may be at the end of the fourth .
foot, eg. offensantes oLsoLoLsod, in which

case the fourth foot is treated like the final foot of the

11n what follows, the primary ictus is represented by ''‚ and the
socondary by l.
