INTRODUCTION.

2. Trocmis.

⁵2. Any one of the substitutos allowed in iambie verses
for the pure iambus may, except as indicated below, also
stand here for the pure troohee, Lo, the metrieal aooent
being, however, in all cases, upon the first syllable of the
foot.

⁵³. Trochaio octonarius (Tetrameter Anatoleofie). —This
verse is used only in lyrio parts of the plays, in oonneetion
with other verses, to form special rhythmie systema.

⁵4. The caesura is (a) usually after the fourth foot, from
whieh foot the daotyl is then exeluded3 (b) sometimes in
the fourth or fifth foot. In this verse a tribraeh, a spondee,
oran anapaestis allowed even in the eighth foot.

⁵5. Troehaio octonarii are peculiar to those parts of a
soene that are intended to be sung. The movement of this
verse may be illustrated by the following ι -

“ Bea‘ms oi moon, like burning lanoes, through the tree-tops flosh and
glisten.‘’

56. Troohaio septenarius (Tetrameter Cataleofio), called
septenarius because only seven feet are complete, though it
really contains seven and a half feet—This is a favorite
verse with Plautus. The oaesura may be (a) after the
fourth troehee, in plaoe of whioh adaetyl is not then ad-
missible3 (b) after the fifth arsis, generally with a minor
caesura¹ after the fourth thesis or the third arsis. In this
verse, as in iambio verse, an anapaest is very rare immedi-
ately after a daetyl. The seventh foot is eommonly kept
pure, though a tribraoh or a daotyl is oooasionally found
The last syllable of the verse may, as usual, be either long
or short. ¹

Tracheia septenarii are suited to a somewhat more quiet,
peaeeful frame of mind. Compare : -

‘⁴ Tell me notin mournful numbers, life is but an empty dream.”
