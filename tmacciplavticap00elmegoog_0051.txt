Terence, as may be seen from Donatus, scenas of a purely
lyric character were marked MMO. (perhaps an abbrevia-

>musical accompaniment, simply Ο. (though this rests upon
the opinion of Ritschl, Donatus giving us no information
on this point), those consisting of ordinary dialogus, DV} ·

of the play (before the prologue) and between the acts.
The music for the plays of Plautus and Terence seems to
have been composed entirely by slaves. The music was
given by a single fluteplayer (tibicen), probably by the
composer himself, with a double flute, or, perhaps we might
say, clarinet, as the instrument bore a greater resemblance
to it than 'to our flute. It was played by blowing into both
tubes at the same time. From the didascalice we leam of
four different kinds of these instrumenta: tibiae parea, in
which the two pipes were of equa] length; tibiae impares,
in which they were of unequal length; tibiae serrcace, of
which but little is known, though they were probably of
equal length;² and dccc dextrae tibiae, in which the two
tubes were of equal length and identical in key and note.
Regarding' the lastmentioned tibiae, we are told by Varro
that the righttube was for leading (tibio cosentiae), the
left for accompanying (tibio morentiae). We have no fur-
ther knowledge regarding the difference between the various
kinds of these instruments3 but we may be certain that the
choica of instrument depended upon the characteres the
