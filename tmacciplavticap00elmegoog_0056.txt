It is important to note, however, that in suoh oases the
long syllable may be shortened only when the short syllable
immediately preoelding begins a word. The shortening,
furthermore, seems to take plaoe only in the following
cases : -

(1) In a dissyllabis iambio word.¹
(2) In a monosyllabioword (or one that has beoome suoh
by elision) preoeded by a short monosyllable (or a word
whioh has become suoh by elision).

(3) In the first syllable of aword of two or more sylla

’ bles preceded by a short monosyllable (or aword that has

beoome suoh by elision);
(4) In the second syllable of a polysyllabis word begin-
ning with a short syllable.

· In the oases under (3) and (4), the rule holds (possibly
with rare exceptions) only for syllables “low by potitiae?
bol hooiop o* short ooroel.

Another effect of the metrioal aooent is frequently seen
in ¹oases where monosyllabio words ending in a long vowel,
or in m, instead of being elided before a following vowel, or
h, reoeive the iotus and are treated as short syllables3 see

later writers, is very eommon in Plautus, as it is in the

found after both long and short vowels and after m3 eg.

1 Here the word-aecem on the initial syllable aided in the shorten-
ing of the final syllable. Compare the shortoning of the originally
long final syllable in milti, libi, sibl, iot, ubi, abl, quom, ego, modo,
