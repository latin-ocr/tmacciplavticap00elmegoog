4. For subjunctive in deliberative questions: qaid
opo? rotat stall Ι dot (instead of quid egomt) Cf. the
English expression, “What do Ι do now (next) ? ''

(b) Subjunctive: 1. nosque with the ablativo and essct
(soret), to represent a condition contrary to fact:
Mea. 1022, absque te essct, rcere lt aot for you.

2. Ne with the perfect subjunctive in prohibitione
is common in Plautus, though very rare later (except
in Cicero's Latere). It is energetic and unceremoni-
ous, and therefore colloquial. ’

95. Tonsos:-

(u) Prcseat: 1. The present indicative is often loosely used
where strict accuracy would require the future or the
future perfect: Stich. 623, deoc salutabo modo: poste cd

‘ te continuo transeo ; Pers. 275, etium respicis (woa't you
lcolc crorrad t) ; Oupt. 331, eum ci reddis alut, praeterea ’
auum nummum uc dcis (for si reddideris, etc).

2. The present subjunctive, instead of the imper·
fect, is sometimes used in conditional sentences,
where the condition is apparently contrary to fact: ·
Ac. 393, si sit domi, dicam tibi.

(b) murore perfect: The future perfect is frequently used,
notas atruefuture perfect to indicate an act to be
finished prior to some future time, but as an ener-
getic future to indicate prompt completiones the
act ot a future time: Bacch. 211, abiem, I’ll be off,·

, Tria. 1007, lubet obseruare quid opat: buc concessero.
Here the force of the tense in tac concessero should
be brought out in translation by using an expression
that connotes the idea of hurried accomplishment, eg.
I 'll step this way, I'll dodge c'a frere, or the like. The
simple future might always be used in such a case,
but there is avery distinct difference in tone between
the two tenses.
