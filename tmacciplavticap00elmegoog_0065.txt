to a more or less clearly defined point in the past.

hears a person say, in reply to a suggestion just
made by some one to whom he is talking, “I hadn't
thought of that,” i.e. “ had not a moment ago, before
you called my attention to it.'' vIt would on such
occasions always be equally appropriate to say, “I
(lid not think of that.'’ The choice of tense depende
