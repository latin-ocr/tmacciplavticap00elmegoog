Sonus 3.

Hegio, having heard from Philocrates (whom he supposes to be Tyn·
darm) the plausible story about the high standing and importunae
at home oi the latter’s pretended master, now puts into execution the
proposed plan for securing the return of his captured son. He sends

’ the supposed 'lyndmus back home to effect an exchange. The
parting, in the presence of Hegio, between the pretended slave and
the pretended master gives an opportunity fora clever bit oi acting.
—The scene opens with a matter-of-tact dialogue in iambic senoni.

As the interest quiokens, and as the time comes to formulate the ·

message to be carried to the prisoner's father (385, cf. 384) and to
say the parting words, the verse changes to trochaic septenaria'3 the

music again strikes up and continues to the eud oi the scene. See
Introd. 57 and 70.
