suasanus.

Tne early Greek comedy seldom employed more than three aetors,
but aiter the chorus was abolished this number was often sxceeded.
With the exception oi the Cistellaria and ¹the Stichus, the plays oi
Plautus always require et least iour; those of Terence require at least
five In the captives four actors are necessary; among these ths parts
might be distributcd as follows:-

’(1) Hegio
2Philocrates, Aristophontes, puer. '
Tyndarus, Philopolemus, the laconas who speaks in Act Ι. Scene 2.
Ergasilus, Stalagmus, the lerarias who speaks in Act ΙΙ. Scene 1,
and Act 111. Scene ὅ.

Resides these, supemumeraries would be necessary, e..g in Act Π
Seenel

The names in fabulae palliatae are commonly Greek names with
Latin forms Such names are usually chosen as will 1n themselves
convey some idea of the characters to whom they belong. ·For' rn-

, stenae, in the present play :—

Ergasilus indicates “the worker” (ἐργάζομαι), who “means husi-
ness'’ andisnottobetritled with. 'she reader should picture himinths
ordinary dress of a parasite, ie. in black or gray garments of outlandish
style, and whatever ‘⁴ extras‘' might add to his ridiculous appearance.

Hegio, “the prominent citicen,” “the leading man” oi the place
(cf. ἡγέομαι). This actor accordingly wears, with befitting dignity,
the usual dress of a well-to-do Greek.

Philocrates, fond of ruling.’' Plautus himself probably spelled '

this name Pilocrates; see note on Talem m 274.

Aristophontes, ‘killer oi chieis” For the Plautina spelling, see
noteonlll.

Philopolemus, “the lover ci war” (φίλος, πόλεμος). For the
Plautine spelling, see note 011274.

Stalagmus, “the dropper.'’
