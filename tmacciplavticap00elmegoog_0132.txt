NOTES.

ARGUMENTUM. “

The argumente prefixed ιο the plays oi Plautus are not the produc·
tions oi that poet, but were written in a later age, during a revival ol
interest in archaic Latin. See Introd. 521. Such briei summaries
were also written for other authors (eg. ior the different books of
Vergil's Aeneid and for the plays oi Terence, by Sulpicius Apollinaris
in the second century nn), the prosody and the language oi the author
in hand being in each case carefully imitated.

1. captust: ie. captus cst,· final s aiter a short vowel was very
iaintly pronouuccd in early Latin. Captus est would therefore easily
become cuptu' est and then (by prodelision) captust. With this dis-
appearance of the initial ε, compare, e.g. optumumst, ior optumum est,
in 103 domist for domi est, in293 the English it's ior it is, etc. On
the position of captust, see Introd. § 99. 'Here captust sounds the key-
note of the entire play, and accordingly takes the most prominent
place for the verb. pugnaHeglonls: probably not a case of hiatus.
Η seems to have been capable of preventing elision and of “making
position ” after ε final consonant. See Introd. ᾗ 74.

2. seruos: for the form, see Introd. §86 ( ).

4. Aword has apparently fallenoutof tbisyerse. SeeApp. stu-

PROLOGVS.

On the prologues ιο the plays of Plautus, see Introd. ς 19.

The νδιε oi prologue seems to have been usually taken by ons of the
younger actore or by the manager oi the company, who was euusd
lor the occasion in a particular costume. While the whole burden ol
the prologues of Terence consists of answers to the unkind criticisms
