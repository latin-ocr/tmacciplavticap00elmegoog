variety oi subject matter and commonly explain the plot ci the play.

1. hos: this leads one to expect a verb to iollow, of which it Isto
be the object or the subject-accusative, but tha anacoluthon in the next

xverse leaves this pronouu without government. The accusative might
however be explained by supposing it to be attracted to agree with
quos.

2. Illi qul astant, -hl etant ambo, etc: similar humor might be
brought out in English z “Those bystanders there—they are standing,
both oi them—the ‘standers’ aren't seated.‘’ This-good-natured at-
tempt to cheat the spectators out of the interesting information the
prologue had led them to believe was coming would in itseli tend to
put them iu good humor. One might have expectent, instead oi bi.
See App. li the text is correct, there is hiatus after qui.

³. testes cetis: equivalent ιο testamini ‚¹ hence the infinitive loqui.

4. hlc: ‚with a gesture toward Hegio’s house. huius: with a
gesture toward Tyndarus.

5. siff> albi: the sibi intensifies the idea of sao, but at the same

, time lays stress upon the interests involved in the possession and in

the general situation; speltae might have taken the place oi suo sibl, Ι

but that would have concerned itseli only with the idea oi possession.

6· operam datis: starts with the idea, put forth aa effora· accord-
ing ιο the application of this idea to various situations, it may be trans-
lated render service, take potas, or (as here) pice attention.

English as “ev'ry,‘’ “quiv’ring,‘’ etc, ior “every,’' “quivering,‘’
etcs: ci. also note ou 306. The ‘⁴ lambio law ’⁹ does not apply to such
cases (see Introd. ς 84), and the scansion dltdrrlm quod is not permissi-
ble. seruos: nominative. The nominative and accusative singular
oi the second declenslon endinthe earliest timesin-os and -οοι, These
andings became -as and -um toward the close oi the third century nc,

consonant). See Introd. §86 (a); cf. note on uiuent, 81. surpmt:

9. eum: to be pronounced οῖιοι. profugiens: the present par·
ticiple here refers to an act prior to that oi the principal verb ; strictly,
it should refer to an act going on at the time oi the selling, but even
Latin,·and especially colloquial Latin, is sometimes inaccurate in its
use oi tenses. The lack oi a perfect active participle is often respon-
sible ior such a use as this; accuracy is sacrificed in the interest oi

brevity. uendldltt ior the long final syllable, see Introd. §82 (e).
