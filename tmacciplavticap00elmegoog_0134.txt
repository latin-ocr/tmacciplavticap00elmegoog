idea? literelly, have you already told os this? (cf. the English slang, ’
“ catch on ?’'). The prologus takes an affirmative answer, on the part
of the spectatore, ior granted, and expresses his satisfactlon with their
attention and interest by eaying optumumst. At this point, however,
ior the purpose ot stirring up his audience, he pretends to see some one
at a distance from the stage waggishly shaking his head, or giving some
other indication of dissent. What is said in lines 11-16 must not be
taken too seriously; the prologue is too good-natured, and too desirous
oi putting his hearersingoodhumor, tolose his tempereasily. optu-
mumst: very well. For the loss ol initial e in est, see note on captust
in verse 1 of the Argumentum. But see App. The forms optimus,
maximus, etc, began to replace the early forms optumus, macomus,
ete, toward the end oi the Republic. ’

11. This verse can be read metrioally only by admitting hiatus
between hercle and ille, and again between illa and ultumas, and by
treating the final syllable of ultumas as long. The first hiatus might ⁸
be obviated by treating the· final syllable oi nepas ae long. The verse
isprobably cormpt. hercle: conseand tim! ultumas: some
one in the edge of the crowd. For the form, see note on optumum in

10. accedito: the future imperative is commonly used only when ’

a distinct interval is supposed to elapse before the command is to take
effect or to be obeyed ; hence its use in lewe, maxims, recipes‚ eto.
Sometimes (and apparently in the present passage) it is used in a
command that is intended to be obeyed as soon as uttered Abscedito
· would seem to make better sense, and is actually adopted by some
editors.

12. si non ubl, etc: es no one makes a move in obedience to his
madito, the prologue changes his tone somewhat3 ii the fellow can·

The following sorts of characterizing clauses should be noted: -

1. Predioating a hypothetical ease: is est qai mentiatur, lta ts c
man who would cheat. In a clause of this type, the subjunctive
has the same force as in an independent parataotical clause3 eg. is
mentiatur, te would obeat.
