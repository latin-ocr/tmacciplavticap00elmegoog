4. Volitive. The relativo clause, besides characterizing the ante-
cedent, may at the same time express the purpose oi the act oi the
prinoipal clause, as in the English sentence, “Men are trying ιο

make machinos that shall² fly”; here the flying of the machines Ι

is the act which the men purpose to bring about, and at the same
time the flying is to characterize the machines—they are to he
dying machines. Cf. Tac. Dici, 28. 6, caius . . . committeretur.

Another type of volitive characterizing clause is represented by
nn est loeas abi sedens, which may have originated in some such
paratacticuse as bic est locas ; hic sedeas (itere ta ο piace ,· sit here,
ty noa like), where sedeas would be a woak jussive subjunctive, ex·
pressing more permission.
