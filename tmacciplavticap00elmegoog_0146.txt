saturitate (from satur, acted with foed), ocoupying the first place in
the clause (see Introd. j 99), has already done justice to the memorias
oi the good things he had to eat ; at an equally emphatic place in the
sentence, 11111111 lingere over memorias oi the all-too-tempting drinks
The dependente oi saturitate upon ebrius is incongruous, and ior that
reason humorous; his condition at such times was the result oi both
iood ¹and drink, and he wished to give tull credit to the merits oi each.

the use of iuncti instead of uincti, in 113, shows that the two captives
uere bound together, and makes it probable that singularias means
separate, ie. oue sor· ecch, instead oi the beavier (maiores) chains
which were used for the two together. This would allow the captives
greater freedom oi movement, and the order would be in harmony with
that in the next line. This word seems extremely rare in any sense

113. For the punctuation, see App. sunt iuncti : aunt alone is
the verb, iuncti expressing the state in which they are.
