him again. consimilis: 01101110 takes the genitive in early Latin, ·

. the dative (commonly) in post-Augustan Latin. The intervening

period is one oi transition, in which both the genitive and the dative
arefrequent. ’

117. semel: emphatic position.

118. postilla: ester 11101, formed like 000100, and differing from it
in meaning, as ille differs from 10. poesis: you would 00001 be able,
ie. nc matter how much you should try; “you can ’⁹ would be potes.

120. uidere: 10011ον10. lta: equivalent 10 tiber lubentius
essequam seruire, depending upon uidere, referring to the preceding
verbs in 118-119. non uidere ita tu quidem: the position 01 10
with its intensiiying quidem indicates an impatient, spiteiul tone.
Hegio says that the 10101100 does uot act as though 10 cared about
being free; ii be did, he would try 10 be a better slave. Slaves were
sometimes manumitted from motives 01 lrinduess cr gratitude; sorne-
times they purchased their freedom from what they had saved (pecu-
lium) out 01 their allcwance.

121. quod dem: (00011100) sor me to 0100, literally, (00011100)
1011101 Ι moy 01000 volitive, characterizing clause (see note on 12). ,
mene: -ne in early, as inclassical, Latin is non-committal. Some·
times the answer “yos’' is expected, sometimes, as here and in 111,
the answer “ uo,'’ but in neither case lethe answer suggested by the
form oi the question, but rather by external circumstances. ln such
cases the use oi -00, instead 01 00000 or nam, produces a certain rhe-
torical effect, the implication being that the answer may saiely be leit
to be inferred. cf. “Do I, or do I not, loolr like an honest man ?‘’
Sometimes 0000010 actually added, as in 'i 13, emitteresne 00000 t See
App. uis dem: the subjunctive in such vcases probably originated
in a deliberative question ; 0101 dem 1 Iu the course 01 time dem came
to be looked upon as depending upon 010. The next step would be the
insertion 01 0 word that would show this dependence, eg. 010 01 010101
but this use 01 01 always remained rare. The play 01 words in this
line should be ncticed: is I buce 0011100 (0100) 10 pice (sor 0101100-
dom), do you 10001 me to 0100 000-110 stip mysels? With the·
expression me dem tapetes, ci. me 0001011 tripedes (1100011374), 00 10
pedes conicere (Ter. Phorm. 190), 10 0101000110νο (Cic. adsum. XIV.
12), and the English expression “take 10 eneis heels.”

122. erit extemplo: the emphatic position chosen for 0111 heightens
the contrast with the 000 estol the preceding verse and intensiiies the
threatening tone: 111ον0 0000 [oi—ll be something 11101 E-il pice to Q
