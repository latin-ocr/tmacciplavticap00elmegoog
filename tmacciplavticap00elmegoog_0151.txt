ia the trouble with. Ι

153. qula: explicative, the scot that, the clause being in apposi-
tion with illud, this use oi prtia is common in Plautus, though in
classica} times it gave place to qnod and cum (see latter part oi note
on quom in 151); 01. 203, noa pudet quio ’. . .; Epid. 101, idne pudet
te quio . . .; Ona. 378, iniquomst qaia . . .; Mil. 1210, istac ocer-
humet qnia . . .; etc, etc. In their origin, qnod and quio aliine
probably represent some accusative construction, quod being the
accusative neuter singular oi a relative ostem, and qaia the accu-
sative neuter plural of a relative i-stem; ci. the ablative qai and the
dative and ablative quibas from the same stem, by the side nithe
ablative qno and the dative and ablative qaia from the ostem. rc-
mlssus est edendi exercitus: the assembly oi the Roman people
known as the comitio 0001011010, though it early acquired political
power, was originally a military organizati0n; the expression for
assembling thia organization was exercitum imperare, and that for
dismissing it was exercitam remittere. The expression is here trans-
ferred to campanies oi banqueters. So long as Philopolemus was
present, there was some one to muster the troops, i.e. some one
to give dinner parties, in his absence, the banqueting army has
disbanded.

1⁵4. nullum: rarely used as a substantive in good classical prose,
except in the genitive and ablative, where it regularly supplanta
neminis and nemine.

(uicisse), 1110101 (uicissem), misti (misisti), scripsit· (scripsisti),
sumpno (sumpsisti), ducti (1011011), duce (1111011011), trono (traxisse),
etc. Such shorter forms are very common in the early dramatists

· and are not unccmmon in later poets. There is a tendency among

recent authorities to regard them as having a different origin ircm the
full forms, but it may be that they are merely the result oi syncope
(see Lindsay, The Latin Loopuaye, p. 464).

156. largitant z this frequentative form is almost entirely confined

to comedy; it here indicates eagerness andunoeremonious haste .

(hurruaway from), and its emphatic position adds to the humor.
They all know too well what it meant tc give Ergasilus his dinner.
prouinciam: office, duty.

157. quod obtigerat, etc: whatever· os it (ie. oi the prouincia)
hod fallente their lot aster the captare os your Philopolemus. With
