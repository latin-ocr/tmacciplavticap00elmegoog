aron io] serr sonna a. ι 85

nocte itae in 127), or, as here, to the immediate future. meon-
cillanem: a form of the future infinitiva found in a few verbs or
the first conjugation (cf. cueruaeceaere, impetrassem, oppugnatione).
The origin of this form is problematical. See note on 33.

169. eccum: ie. ecee eam; eam, eos, aas, ec, illam, ete, are
similarly combined into eccam, eccos, etc. The accusative seems to
bc due to the general objectiva feeling involved in ecce, which, with its
accusative, isoften used without reference to the construction of the
rest of the sentence, cg. Ter. Phorm. 484, eccam ab sac palaestra
ecit sores; Plaut. Mil. 1281, nescio qais eccum incedit. Eccum is
commonly used oi a person already in sight, but see, in addition to the
present passage, 1015; Ant. 120; Aci. 781; Bacch. 568. eccum
hic: the initial it, as frequently in Plautus, preventa elision, and
makes the preceding syllable long. See Introd. ς 74, and App.

171. hoc: ablative; see note on qai in 28. pote: (sc. esse)
used hera for posse. Either potis or pote may be used in early Latin
as nominative or accusative, and as singular or plural.

172. faxint: ie. secerr’at3 such archaia forms long continued to
be used as favorfte forms in prayers, just as early forms of expression
hare preserved themselves in English ; eg. “ Thy kingdom come,”
“ Thy will be eloce‚” etc. Tha perfect tense in its future uses disre-
gards the progress of the aet, and conceives of it as one that is to be
promptly and energetically performed and finished (cf. the English
“he gonew instead of “go 1”). This tense is accordingly used in
prayers only where the speaker is, or pretends to be, stimed with such μ
emotion at the thought of the possible occurrence of the act that he
cannot think oi the progress of it, but only the prompt accomplish-
ment offit. Eormal or indifferent prayers take the present tense.
See App. quo: caecitates, though the English now usas atrahere
in this sense. foras: see note on 114.

1⁷³. nusquam: sometimes, as here, used in early Latin in the
sense of no whither, where we should expect oca quoquam itis com·
monly used of rest in, instead of motion toward, aplaoe. Such con-
fusion of meanings is common enough in colloquial language, cf. intus
usually evitata, but used also in the sense of from within (eg. Most.
676); peregre may indicate, in Plautus, rest in, motion to, or motion
from. quod selam: titat I know os (so sor as Ι know)'; scium
is the subjunctive used in a restrictive clause which itsclf represents
a development from a clause of characteristic.

1⁷4. tu: used for emphasis, and to coutrast with id: abydo Ψ
cele Q? mist: i.e. mi ast (mi for milti).
