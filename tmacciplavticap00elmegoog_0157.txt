202. sl. . . niara adiuuat: for some reason not yet understood, a
condition iu which the subject of the verb is au indefinite mcoud per·

20³. This line ‘offers a good illustratiou ol the two common uses
of ut: (l) to introduce an objectiou to some oue’s statement, (2) to
introduce the reply to such au objection. uos pudet qula: such
