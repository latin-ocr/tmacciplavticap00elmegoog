shouldn’t turo up messing—I see tlt—on this emphasis upon “ that'’⁴
reproduoes the emphasis brought out bytho position of the clause
ne . . . essemus, which would normally follow the word upon which
it depende (of. 255, cunct ne, etc). ln quaestlone: t'o quaesti· 1
one esse is used in the sense of to be missiny,· literally‚ to bc (the
one couplet) in a search. Similar expressions are common in Plau-
tus; eg. Pera. 523 Paeon 6633 Miz.1279; Trio. 2782 cist. 5933
eas. 530. .

2⁵4. uinclis: such-forms, uinclum, saeclum, periclum, etc, arethe
earliest forms and are more common in Plautus than uinculum, soe-
oniam, periculum. The parasitis 11 between the c and 1 arose from
an (unconscious) effort to facilitate the pronunciation. circum-
moeniti: with moenirc for the later munire, cf. coercuit ior curauit
(0. Ι. L. Ι. 600), loedos for ludos (0. Ι. L, Ι. 567), etc. Instead of oe
in such words, ot is frequently found, and both ot' and oe continued to
bc used in inscriptions even in classioal times.

eet alone is the verb, the coptus being used in 'the predicate to express
the state.

257. au: an commonly introduces the second part of a disiunctive
question, but in early Latin and even in the poete oi the classical
period it is frequently used as a simple interrogative. The ‘same use
is occasionally found in Livy and later prose. ut: cor would be
more common after conso.

258. sim mercatus: the subjunctive may be due to any one of
these causes (orto all combined), vin: (1) to a desire to represent
the quos-clause as the indirectly reported thought suggested (by the
question) to the minds of the persons addressed3 (2) to a desire to
emphasize the eausul relation oi the quos-clause to the clause upon

. which it depends (see App.); (3) to the fact that it depende upon

another subJ'unctive.
