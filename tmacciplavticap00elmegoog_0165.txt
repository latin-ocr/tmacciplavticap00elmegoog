(cf. “as a matter of fact''). Such an expression following a statement
implies that what has been already alleged is not true, but that what fol·
lows is. This relation between what follows and what has preceded is
thus one oi opposition, and uuum at length came to be felt merely as
an adverb equivalent to but. fraglat (ie. srupi est): icabod sor
anyttiap ,· scapi was originally felt merely as a dative oi service from
fruc (cf. Pseud. 468, taurea ero srupi ionae), sor uae ; butas far use
practically meant acatal, this dative came 1ο be regarded, and used,
as an indeclinable adjective, meaning proper, honest, discreet, etc.

270. quid tu: quid and quid tu are frequently used merely to·
secure the close attention oi the person addressed to a question about
to be asked, performing the same iunction as the English “ howis it ? ”
“say 1” ·'‘ by the way 1” or the like. With tu, probably no particular
, verb was felt to be omitted; it merely stands in a general way as the
subiect oi action. umnelin: represents exactly the same use of the
subjunctive as in uelim (Isbouid like). .

2⁷1. quod sit: witich would be. Ii the quod-clause were used in
the sense ciuitatis, the indicative would here be used, as 11 would
then be either a‘determinative clause (tte particular oue of these
alternatiaes utici, etc), or one equivalent to st with the indicative
(whatever ia, ie. ty aapthiay is, eta, that ia catat quat). In the
latter case the characterizing idea, no matter how prominent, would
not give rise to the subjunctive. See Appeadia to Bennett's Latia
Grauamar, ᾗ 402, with the references there given. longissume:
one would expect longimanum ,’ the adverb gives the degree to which
the idea of sit a malo is true, the adjective would ascribe to the ante·
cedent of quod a characteristic (a mala longimanum), y

27³. erat: Philocrates used the perfect suit in the preceding
verse; the imperfect here shows that hls mind is wandering back
and dwelling, as it were, antid the former scanes. quam sl mm:
one might expensatum, but quam si here follows the same con·
stmction as when it means aa 11 (ci. note on quasi in 181), the im-
perfect here representing the present tense thrown back into the past.
In early Latin, however, the present subiunctive is apparently ire-

quently used in unreal present conditione and the imperfect in unreal
