340. aestumatum: with a patae aet apoc him,· literally, ep·
praised· the amount thus iixed was to be forfeited to Hegio in ease
the supp0ffld slave failed to return. See App. des: the rule com-
monly given, that the present subjunctive in commende is used chiefly
of an indefinite person, is not true for any period of Latin. In
Plautus and Terence there are only twelve instances 41 this use ad-¹
dressed to an indefinite person, while there are 128 instances addressed
toa definite person. In Cicero there are only four instances (not
›counting those used as protases, eg. repes, respondeam) addressed to
an indefinite person, while there are twenty-two (all in the Epistulae)
addressed to a definite person. See App.

rhetorical, energetic use of the future perfect at the end of a line, see
note on icero in 194, with the App. on that passage.

342. tuom: this word and tua in the next line are emphasized by -

tense from that found in 194, 293, 341, etc. ·

345. omne: theatrale thirty. See App. transactum reddet:
differs from transigat in calling attention to'the state resulting from
the act; translyet would refer merely to the act itself. Cf. the Eng-
lish phrase, “ get a thing finished‚” instead 'of ‘³ linish 4111144.μ
