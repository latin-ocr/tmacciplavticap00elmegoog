377. omnem rem: the 1010ῑο11010, loosely added as an appositive
tothequidclauses.

379. patrem: the reference 01 this word in this and the following
lines is intentionally leit ambiguous.

380. rebitas: irom re andbitire (1000) ; adhaere, perditore, inter-
hitere, and other compounds also occur in Plautus. See note on
arbiter 111211. si 11011 rebitas: the protasis oi dem. Notice the
loose use oi the present tense. 111 . . . dem: with the understandina
that. Bennett calls such clauses “ stipulative.’'

382. The hidden meaning should not be missed.

383. mimum aduortas uolo: such uses originally consisted oi
two independent sentences, animum adhortari uolo, 0000110011οηὶ I
1010111. See 11010 011 360.

385. adhuc locorum: hitherto ,· literally, up 10 this point 'os time,

392. me honore honestiorem. . . iecit: has shown 0100000001
consideration ,· literally, has mode rnc neore honored than honor. Again
the double meaning should be noted. Hegio would understand the
