stand, on my account (Plaut. Most. 355), 1116111 uicem (Cic. Fam. XII.
23. 3). Bennett (Lot. Gran, Appetitas, 310. 3) thinks that uicem
was originally an accusative of apposition (= 611 611 amoenae), aud
cite‘s the present passage and Most. 355 as supporting this view.

401. me 1116 ualere: Tyndarus wants to put in an effective plea
for himself, but has some hesitation as to how he can proceed without
arousing the suspicion oi Hegio. He is-accordinglysomewhat confused
at first hy Philocrates' question, indicating, as it did, that the interview
was about to close. This confusion causes him to repeat aimlessly the
same words he has just used (391),1116111“6 ualere; but 116 suddenly
' rises to the occasion, and launches boldly out into words that will sound
innocent enough to Hegio, but which 616 intended as a plea to Philo-

v cratestoremember the fidelity of his slave, thus leitaprisoner. This
‘ effort oi Tyndarus is a masterpiece. It is fully matched, however, by
the reply oi Philocrates. tute, etc: 111 616116 would commonly be v
emphatic ; the enclitic -te makes it doubly so. The unusual emphasis

seems to imply that 1116 information about to be given would commonly
116 furnished by the master about his slave, rather thanby the slave
about himself. In this ease, however, yon (slave theoph you cre) are
