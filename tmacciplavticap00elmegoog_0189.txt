sal-⁵32. maxumas . . . haereo: set on scat (sonte) hope piece
os consensa, (sonae) tomsoolery. nugas ineptl(as): ii the text is
correct, the s must be elidad, or else we must read irreptt'as. See App.
· incipieus: the speaker thus addresses himself in answer to the
questions he has just put ιο himself. No promising plan of action,
however, suggests itself at the moment, and in his despair he ejacu-
