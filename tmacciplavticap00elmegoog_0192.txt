indicative in indirect questions (see note on 206 b) is most common
in questions with an' imperative, or with some form oi the verb that
makes it possible to treat the question as independent, eg. dic quir
est. This seems to indicate that such questions were not felt dis-
tinctly as indirect questions, but as not yet far removed from para-
taxis (dic l quis est i). Three stages oi development may be assumed:
(1) dic! quis est? (2) disquis eat, (3) dic quierit. siet: ior the
form, see Introd. ξ 88 (a).

561. albat: we use the imperfect in the same way, ag. “some
one was tellinp me the other day that you had been robbed. Is it
so?’' The view that aibat sometimes has the force oi a perfect is
quite unjustified. For aibat instead oi ciebat, see note on servibas in
247. haud uidl magis: a phrase used much like our ironical “I
dare say l” literally, I hace aot seen (any coe) more (so than ite is).

562. Alcumeus, Orestes, Lycurgus: famous madmen oi an-
tiquity. Alcumeus: the Greek form ἰεἈλκμέων (Ἀλκμαίων). In

lacking in the Greek word ; with the first a in Alcumeus, ci. Aescula-
pius (Ἀσκληπιός), techinae (τέχναι), minc (μνᾶ), dractuoeu (δραχμή).
Alcumeus killed his mother. Orestes: he murdered -his mother,
clytemnestra, and was driven mad hythe Furies. Lycurgum: the
Thracian king who was driven mad by Dionysus. postea, theru
literally, afterward, ie, aiter admitting that he isacomrade oi mine,
we must admit that all madmen are.

563. una opera . . . qua ι just comacli ca,· literally, cy one (aad
thereme) oyeacy. . . by' whiclt; see note on 293. at: ct sometimes
introduces an expression oi surprise, indignation, or the like; such
feelings involve an adversative relation-opposition to what was
expected. iurclier: pellows'-bird,⁹ literally, eoae-bearn. The
furca was a iork-shaped irame which, ior purposes of punishment,
was put on the neck, and to the two arms of which the culprit’s arms
were bound. .

⁵64. non ego te noui? I do not know you (eoasoyss Non in
questions frequently differs from accae in implying surprise at the
thought that a thing is not sc, while irenae implies confidence that the
thing is so ; ci. “you do not think so i ’' with “ do yon not think so i ”
Nonne, however, is rare in early Latin. pol: pud!

566. The chiasmus in this line is noteworthy. eum ignoras:
effluamus.
