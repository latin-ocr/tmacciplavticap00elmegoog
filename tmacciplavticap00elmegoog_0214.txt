866. uidere: ie. sideria mlqnidem murlo: tt's sor mamis
(in nep own interest) that I ’nt tungry. Ergasilus, ln ieet, pretends to
misunderstand Hegio’s nubi as modiiying norim (instead oi didm,
as Hegio intended). Notice that nn· in miqnidenr isshort; ci ιῐᾳοιᾶιιι
(⁹20). ·
867. tuo arbitratu: us pou plenae, ct noar pleasant, expressinga
williugness to acknowledge the truth oi the last words oi Ergasilus
molle patior: meant by Hegio in the sense oi Ι readilp prent it, ie.

Ι know you well enough to grant that, when it' comes to eating, you
are “ iu it” ior yourself only. consuetus puer: Ergasilus pre-
tends to understand Hegio‘s words (focile patior) in au obscene sense,
I recdily submit, and raphes Ι suppose so ; pou nod the dobitnlten a boy.

868. Iuppiter. . . perdant: the use oi perdant (perdat, perduint,
etc.) in eurses, though extremely common, is coufined almost exelu-
eively to make-believe curses, that are not really meant by the speaker ;
hence the present tense is regularly used instead oi the perlect; see
note and App. ou 172. te hercle: Ergasilus begins as though about
to utter a curse against Hegio, in reply to the latter’s curse against
him. All oi this is οι course good-natured raillery, and Ergasilus, aiter ἶ
an insinuating pause, substitutes for the expected perdunt anutterance ’ ¹
oi a very different character3 te becomes the subject oi apere, instead
oi the object of perdant. aequomst: an English-speaking person
would be likely to say, tt would be proper, but it must not be supposed
that est in such an expression was ielt ae we leel “would be.” The
Latin est means merely is; in the present passage, ior instance, the
conception is the proper thing to do is ιο titoni nte (thcnks cre due me
instead oscenses). See note on 61.

870. nunc tu . . . places : ie. I am now ready to accept your invi-
tation. Heretofore Ergasilus has had his doubts about the character oi
the dinner he was likely to get at Hegio’s (ci. 179 ff. and 497) and has
been waiting and hoping for a more promising invitation. Now, how·
ever, he feels sure that the good news he isabout to announce to Hegio
will incline the latterto give him oi his best. post tempus: behind
time; Hegio means that his misiortunes have leit him in no mood for
aleast.

871. igitur: connected with the demonstrative pronoun is, and
originally meaning, in thot ease, etthei time; the tri-clause seems
here to be in appositior with the demonstrative idea in tpttnr:
in thesollonn'ng ense, viz. ιζι I had cone some tinae apo, then, eto, cl.

Mil. 772, qnando habebo, tqttrrr dubo. Ipitnr is sometimes used in
connection with deinde and mnan ; ag. aad 930, nbi liter ero, ιοιιιο·
