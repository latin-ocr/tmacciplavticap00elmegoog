this is a common 1011111111101101011111111 certifying to the truth 01 an
assertion, though the subjunctive ito. ..amet nt is more common.

Cora is another name ior Proserpina, the queen' of the lower regions3
but it was also the name of a town iu Latium, 1 coincidence which ¹
suggests to Ergasilus the idea 01 swearing by several other towns in
Iatium (Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, and Aletrium), as though they,
ιοο, were goddesses. Ergasilus' indifference to the real gender of
these town names and the consequential aire he gives himself by swear·
ing in Greek, instead 01 Latin, add'touches 01 humor to the scene.
