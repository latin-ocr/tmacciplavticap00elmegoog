esi. giratus: (sc. esee) here a participle; see note on 19.

892. ain tu: (ie. alstra tal) merely a formula expressive oi
indignation, wonder, or the like, what do you mean, eir? 1t is here
prompted by Hegio’s et· nera autumas. etlam, sancte quom . . .
iurem: anea Ι would take even a solemn oatb (ts acted to do ro);
attane cantate is given an emphatic position ior the purpose oi contrast-
ing his present moad with his previous inclination to jesi in taking
oaths (881 n). For other interpretatione, see App. The mood oi
tarem is due to the fact that it is felt, virtually, as the conclusion oi a
“contingent’' (“ less-vivid-iuture,” “ideal'’) condition; it is uninflu-
enced by paon, which in Plautus takes the indicative (see notes on
146 and 244).

896. nam: (a aera proper thina to da) sorr nisimentisclnatns
probe ero: if Ι shall not (prone to) baec pinea an nonest repert ‚· the
meaning, however, oi mantiscinatus (a word occurring only here) is
doubtful.

898. unde id: at abaco capenae ia that to be ¹clane? literally,

iuuenca ie that t The tal refers-to the whole idea of dapinabo aiaam, ⁴

rather than to uictam alone (hence id instead oi is), but the question
seems rather pointicss after the meurance J‘ust given by Hegio. Erga-
silus is, however, using the formalities oi a· legal bargain (attenuatio)
and he wants to make sure that there will be no misunderstanding.

899. ego tuom tibi: notice the emphasis obtained by the juxta-
positiones these pronouns. respondeo: I montiae (assare yon) in
return; the word here has its etymologieai meaning, with a play, oi
course, upon its usual sense.

900. curs: used absolutely, managa. qnam optume potes:
ae best poa can,· potas is frequently omitted in such cases bene
ambula: see note on 452.

ACT IV. SCENE 3.

901. illio ι probably to be pronounced ille ; see note on 751. See
Apgtiss. lam: seenoteon 251. ut: hoa. collos: collaris an
anteclassical torm ior callam. tegoribus: torporibus (hom
masa). The alliteration is noteworthy in this and the following
vagg} laniis lassitudo: because the lanii will be kept so busy.

908. nam: (enough as this) foe. This is the usual interpretation,
