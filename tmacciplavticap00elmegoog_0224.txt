lact in Ter. Aa. 841). Tyndarus is contrasting daylight with the
darkness of the stone querries, from which (thanks to Hegio) he is
now allowed ιο emerge (cf. 730).

1009. ettu: sc. salae. exigo: here apparentlyin the sense of
andare.

1010. laxo: parenthetica] and without influence upon the con·
struction of the rest of the sentence. For the force of the future per·
fect (instead of the future), see notes on 194, 293, 341, 495.

1011. surpuit: for the form, see note on 760.

1014. illic: probably to be pronounced illc; see note on 751.

v The more remote demonstrative is here used toindicate a return to

Stalagmus as subject (the is just used, had referred to the father of
Philocrates) 3 after the attention has thus been recalled ιο him, he is
then referred to as tanc. But see App. reducimur: one might
expect the perfect tense.

1015. quid huius fllium: what os this maa’s son? At first
thought, it may seem strange that Tyndarus receives the announce-
ment that Hegio is his father with a question about Philopolemus, but
it must be remembered that Tyndarus has been looking forward to and
longing for the return of Philopolemus as the one thing that could res-

, cue him from his suffering and restore him ιο freedom. Upon seeing

Philocrates again before him, itisnatural thathisfirst thought shouldbe
whether Philopolemus had been brought back with him. As his atten-
tion is absorbed by this (to him) all-important question, the improba-
ble announcement J'ust made by Philocrates, that Hegio, the man who
is responsible for his suffering, is his father, makes but little im-
pression upon him. Even when Philocrates repeats his assertion,

· Tyndarus is still very indifferent about the matter ; indeed, at first he

ignores the allusion to Hegio, and merely says (1019) that he will
make trouble for the slave who stole him. quid huius: thel
makes the preceding syllable long. Possibly, however, we should
read hdios; see G.-L. 104. 2, eccum: see note on 169.

1016. an: aaran in early talin as co, aa, or all.

1017. quin: see notes on 560, 589, 643, 856.

1018. tuos: used objectively.

1019. grandim contrasted witli poraom (1018). ad carnu-
ficem: differs from ccraufci, in calling attention merely to the idea
of motion, while the dative with dabo would connote the “ for· ” idea
aswell astho “to'' idea.

1020. Imperfect in metrical structure. mentam mercedem
odesert (literally, reward) deecrocd
