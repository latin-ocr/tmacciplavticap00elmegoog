recall something almost lorgotten, are common pheuomena. See App.

1024. per nebulam: would be more appropriate within memo-
riam regredior, but it is apparently ielt as going with audisse ‚· 01.
Pseud. 463, quae quasi per nebulam scimus atque audiuimus. The H
ο1 Rapio makes the preceding syllable long. nocarler: when used
01 personal experiencc, memini (to which in memoriam regredior is

does this very briefly, with the words, ualcte et plaudite, 01 simply
plaudite ,· but in Plautus, his address is commonly, as in the present
play, somewhat elaborate. It is possible that lines 1029-1036 were pro-
uounced hy the entire company iu concert, instead 01 by a single actor.

1031. pueri suppositio: as in the Trucuieatas, in which play
