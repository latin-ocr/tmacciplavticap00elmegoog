APPENDIX.

Tuis Appendix is devoted chiefly to references, comments, or expla-
nations that seem called for by statements made in my notes, or by
readings adopted in my text. It bas been taken ior granted that users
oi this book who are especially interested in the constitution of tho
text vvill have acoess to all the standard editions, vvith their manuscript
readings, critical notes, and appendixes.

Aaounnnruu. 4. The various emendations ol this line scemtome
so uncertain that I have adopted none oi them in the text. Possibly
Plautus wrote captum alternatum (Bragmann). , ¹

5. Editors commonly avoid the hiatus by writing in ibus ior inibi.

Line 2. The most plausible emendation suggested ior illi put·
ostent seems to me to be that oi Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 138),
viz. non uili puio 010οι, but the reading is so uncertain that the best
course seems to be to follow the Mss. See my note.

bi: editors commonly read i, but the manuscripts uniformly read
ln', which (vvith Baoh and Leo) 1 have retained. For parallel instantes
oi ille and bic, both referring to the same person, see dape. 1014, illic
indictum secit,· nam hunc en Alide hnc reducimus,¹ Mil. 22, pertume-
rem hoc bominem siquis uiderat, out plenarum pleniorem quum illic
est; cf. dape. 110-112, istos captiuos duos, lteri quos emi de praedo de
quaestoribus, his indito cotenes, etc. (according to the manuscripts);
ib. 733-734, obducite istum . . . iubete huic cresens compedes inpinpr'er.

10. putri huiusce: this line has hitherto been considered corrupt
and has been variously emended, but see my note, with references
there given. ’

optumumst: Lindsay (The Journal os Philolopp, 52, p. 287 ) thinks ’
that “absolute certainty is attached” to Leo’s emendation, optume
est. The latter certainly represents the regular usage in this sense,
but under conditione similar to those in the text, vve might in English
say either “very vvell ’³ or “very good,” and it seems at least possible

that optumum est was occasionally used in the sense oi optume est.
