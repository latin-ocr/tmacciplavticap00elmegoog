gent futurity, see Cornell Stndtes in Classical Pln'toiow, vl. There Ι
have shown that the noluerim in this line cannot be olassed with such
expressions. The perfect tense in such future uses oi the subjunctive
denotas enerpetic aetion prompttn performed end proneptis completed.
Accordingly, no verb whose meaning is opposed to this idea is iound
with the perfect tense in this use. With uos qnod monitos noluerim .

⁷2-vs. The repetition oi scortum in 73 has caused most editors to

ior by Ergasilus’ evident desire to lay all possible emphasis upon the
point that he is making. He is contending that, in spite of what the
derisores say, it is pemectly appropriate that he should be called
“ Scortnm” ,· sor, he says, n ts his scortum ttat tlte tooer tnooltes, nien

⁷4. Scortum is inserted by Bentley aiter irenocutnm. 1 have not Ι
incorporated it into the text, but Ι believe it to be correct, ior the iol·
lowing reasons: (1) it is certain that a word has dropped out3 (2)
scortum has to be mentally supplied, in any case, to make sense, even
ii omitted irom the text; (3) the 'preceding lines show that the
speaker is making the most oi this word by constant repetition and by
centering the thought upon it, (4) the word would easily be omitted
by a scribe, who, glaucing up from his copy ior a moment, aiter reading
inuocntnrn would, upon turning again to his copy, mistake the -tnm oi
scortum for the last syllable copied, and would begin writing again
with on non, etc. The loss oi (esti est), supplied by Camerarius,
could not be so easily accounted for.

'll-8³. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 296 t.) regards 77-79 and
rebus. . . miseri, in 82 and 83, as interpolatione.

77. This line is commonly regarded ss spurious (see, ior instance,
Spengel, Philologus 37, 421 ; Brix, od toc.; Langen, Ptantin Studien,
p. 271), but, it seems to me, without sufficient reason. Niemeyer de·
tends it (Zetnennn s. Gymnosielnesen ior 1885, p. 361).
