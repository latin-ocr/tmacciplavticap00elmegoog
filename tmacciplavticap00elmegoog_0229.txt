85-87. Ronwadowslri (Wiener Studien, 13, p. 324), following.
Guyet, reiects these lines, but without sufficient reason. One is
tempted to follow SpeiJ'er (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 139) in retaining the
cenes, which the Mss. have et the end 01 85, by letting 11 begin 86,
canis sumni(s) quondo, etc, and changing redierunt to rediere. But
it seems equally plausible to suppose that cenes crept into the Mes. from
the margin, where some scribe had written it to make unmistahable
· the meaning 0100001101. ’

89. potest: see Leo, Plautia. Forscb. p. 12.

90. Editors commonly omit ire and read ilicet, necdlessly altering
the Mss. Instead 01 reading uil ire entre, Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI.
p. 139) suggests u’l ire intre. Sec Skutsch, Iambenleu'reunp und
sennen, pp. 12-11. ’

94. This line is commonly considered corrupt, but see my note,
with references. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. pp. 296 1.) regards
both 93 and 94 as interpolated. On the elision, before a following
initial vowel, 01 0111101 syllable ending ln s, see Le0, Plautia. Forscb.
pp. 22411. ‡

102-107. Langen regards these verses as spurious (Beitrdpe, p.
206; Plautia. Studien, p. 271).

102. A word must have fallen out from this verse, but it seems
impossible to restore it with any degree 01 certainty.

104. nullust: Brix reads necullust; Leo, nam 1111110 est,· but
neither 01 these readings would have been likely to be corrupted into
the reading 011110 Μο0. (trulla est). Miiller reads in iuuentute,·
Ussing, ient irruentutis,· others change the order 01 words. Possibly
ipsi has fallen out after sese, the scribe having looked away from his
copy 01101 reading sese, aud, upon returning‚ mistaken the -st' 01 ipsi
1011110 last syllable copied. The difference between i and 0 111 capital
Mes. is often almost indistinguishable. 11 ipsi originally stood in the
text, iuuentutis must haye been read 1111100101ἱο 00 in Most. 30, Ps.
202⁶, etc.

110. Τ110 colon is commonly placed after tu. As the caesura
comes aiter sis, it seems more probable that tu is 10 be taken with
what follows. Brix-Niemeyer suggests the possibility 01 11110, but in
the text retains the usual punctuation.

111. de: commonly changed to uby editors3 ci. de quaestoribus
in34.

112. 1110 .· most editors change this to is (ets), but the reading
01 1110 Mss. seems correct; 01. stt-548, bic. . . istic,· 7330310110
