mannum. 188

193. opud: Leo (Plautio. Forsan. pp. 228 ff.) argues that thed
in opud was silent in cases like this.

tropeositom .· this is probably the correct form ior Plautum see my
note. Harrington (Proceediuys os tlte American Philoloyt'ool Asscct'o·
tion ior 1898, p. xxxiv.) argues that there was no letter a, even in
the earliest Latin alphahet. See Hempl’s article on Tne Ortyt'u os tbe
Latin Letters d ond Z in Transactions os tlte Am. Pan. Asa, XXX.
p. 24.

194. tuero .· Meiiart (de sut. euecti usu Plout.) shows that this use
oi the future perfect, where one might expect the future, is found
chiefly at the end oi a line or in diaeresis, and that the choice of this
tense is frequently determined by metrical convenience. It must not,
however, be supposed that no difference was ielt between the future
perfect and the future. Very often the energetic and the calm forms
of expression (eg. “ l'll be off” and ‘⁴ I'll yo ”) are equally appropri-
ate in the context. In such cases, metrical convenience may deter-
mine the choicc, but the difference between the tenses nevertheless
remains clear and distinct See note.

199. Niemeyer (Ploutin. Studien, pp. off.) favore the reading et
em'li lupeno eamque inyent'ts, etc. See Nettleship, Lectores ond
Essem, p. 343; Karsten in Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 304. The reading ol
the Mes, however, may be correct aiter all (see my note).

201. Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVl. p. 144) suggests Etulotidne multo
datalia multu ruera cietur. Ihave ,not been able to see what Schebor
says oi this passage in the Journal des bots. rusa. Ministeriums der
Volnscuflaldruny, Sept. 1891, pp. 57-84; Oct. pp. 1-7.

211. For another view regarding the etymology ol oroneo, see Fay
in Vinson‘s Reuue de linyuistique, 1898, pp. 373 ff.

21¹7. The insertion oi atque before eu seems the hest oi the various
emendations oi this line.

243. ease nunc: nunc is commonly dropped by editors3 but see
my note.

244. quom: perhaps Plautus wrote quoi. See Speijer in Mnemo-
syne, XVI. p. 144.

246. perque: ior the pronunciation perq see Skutsch, Studien,
p. 152. Lindeay apparently rejects the possibility oi the scansion
quod boetico (Journal of Philoloyy, 22, p. 4).

250. It is quite possible that we should, with SpeiJ‘er (Mnemosyne,
xvr. p. 140), rem u aaa, insum or n noo. .

258. The impression‚ sometimes given hy grammars, that causal
qui-clauses require the subjunctive, is a mistakon one. Such a clause
