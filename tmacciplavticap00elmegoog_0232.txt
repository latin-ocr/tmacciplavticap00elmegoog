may take either the subjunctive or the indicative. The differenda
between the moods seems to be that the subjunctive lays particular
’ stress upon the causal relation, while the indicative merely states the
fact, and leaves the logical bearing oi the clause to take care oi itsell.

280. This line 1s considered corrupt. It rs barely possible that the
usual Aleis may here be Aleis (cf. Apollo and Aprilim m Hor 00. 3. 4;
I'talas and Italas), or that we should read Aleis.

286. qaam: it has been supposed that qaast' must 00 taken with
propter diuitias, but Ι 000 not see that it yields satisfactory sense when
so understood. Furthermora the position of qaosi is asemona objec-
tion to such an interpretation. The explanation given iu my nota
seems to me satisfactory, and the only one not open to objections.

309. aolaeram: Brix conjectured coluerim for the aolaerom of
the Mas, but this conjecture is based upon a wrong conception oi
the force oi the perfect subjunctive. This use oi the perfect subjunc-

either early or classical Latin. See note on qaod . . . aolaeoiln in 53,
