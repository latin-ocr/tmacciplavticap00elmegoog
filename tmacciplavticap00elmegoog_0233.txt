346. Tho expression “predicating characterizing,” found in my
notes, is adopted from Hale.

352. Mihly (Zettscltyt f. d. Oesterreicltisclen Gynenosiem 38. p.
588) suggests lic celere eut for boc cedere ud. ’

359. This line has heretofore beon supposed to be corrupt. The
supposed metrical difficulty is commonly obviated by writing monum ⁹
for demonstru; Lindsay retains demonstra, but writes doce for elice.
The line is probably correct as it stands ; see my note and cf. Skutsch’s
“ Ausbliclr‚‘’ on pp. 141 ff. of his Forscbunpen.

387. See note.

392. Langen (Pleutin. Studien, p. 274) would reject this linc on
the ground that semper fecit is absum, coming from a prisoner cap-
tured only the day before (cf. 110 n), and that such expressions aa
are here found would not be used by a slave.

394. num quidem .· is commonly changed to nom equidem, ontlre 1 ’

'ground that in the eight other passages where the phrase occurs it

Classica, 3. p. 84) suggests ut alibi et tn te for calere et tute. ,

403. me aduersatum tibi: Ι see no sufficient reason for changing
this reading of the Mss. It is in perfect harmony with (nos) internos
fuisse ingenio baud discordabilz‘ in 402. Tyndarus is dwelling upon
tho mutual relations of good-will exlating between thern, and neque me
aduersatum tibi is needed to carry out this idea after the preceding
imque te commeruisse culpem.

417. meus esses: commonly considered corrupt, but see my note.

413. The reading of the Mss. is commonly altered, hut see my note. ·

420. uideas: for arguments in favor of the view that the subjunc-
tive never has the power of expressing ability, and that this must not,
therefore, be translated by cun see, sec Cornell Studles ln Classical
Philotium, VI. p. 198. For a counter argument, see Bennett, ib.
IX. p. 41.

430. quo minus: one is strongly tempted'to write quom minus.
