caue ta. Nettleship (Laetaredaad Essaps, p. 343) suggests coelio
(see Serv. on Aen. IV. 409). It is barely possible, however, that the
second syllable oi a word oi three or more syllables may be shortened,
even when it is long by nature (see Introd. ς 84, 4). At any rate,

such phenomena are so frequently presented by Mss. that one cannot
lightly dismiss them as not worth considering. See the readings oi
the Mss. in Aul. 482, minore; 699, herile ; Epld. 338, qnidto; Mero. 841,
est stipam· Pseud. 498, dmdrts,· Stich. 700, dntloa, etc. Iisch (De
Plauti correptione secandae syllabae vocabulorum polysyllaborarn,
qaae mensura iambica incipiunt) gives twenty-three such instanoes oi
shortening in Plautus, 'in trisyllabis words alone (though a iew oi
these instances do not properly belong in bis list), and many similar
instanees in longer words. When the second syllable is long by posi·
tion, a similar shortening is very common. Esch gives seventyseven
such instaures in trisyllabis words in Plautus, and many others in
longer words. Under these circumstances, Ι have allowed the reading
oi the Mss. to stand, though not without misgivings. See Skutsch,
Iambenkireuny arrd Spaizese, p. 12; Studien zur Plani. Prosodr‘e,
p. 108; heo, Plautia. Forsch. p. 292. '

432. te‘ nredside mitti: the te is commonly disearded but, in my
judgment, without sufficient reason. '

435. tc lic: commonly written ted hic to avoid the supposed hia-
tus, but the reading oi the Mss. may be correct. See my note.

444. This verse has been variously emended, but is probably
correct as it stands. See note.

4⁵8. modo cepticos: Miiller (Rhein. Mas. LIV. p. 385) regards
Fleckeisen’s modo (ad) captiuos as “absolut sicher'’ ; ci. 126.

466. On the elision oi s beiore a following initia} vowel in Plautus,
see Leo, Plautia. Forsclt. pp. 224 ff. For another possible explanation,
see Spengel in Philologus, XXXVII. p. 436. Editors have commonly
altered the reading oi the Mss. here to acc magis, to make it conform
to supposed metrical requirements. Similar changes bave been made
in numerous other cases oi similar character. Leo now shows that the
Mss. are probably right aiter all.

4⁷1. asababselli : frequently changed to imi snbsclli, but even ii
this made the interpretation sasier, the evidence in iavor oi the read-
ing oi the Msa, supported, as it is, by the Mss. in Stich. 488, is so
strong that suob an arbitrary alteration seems unjustiiied.

4⁷9. Editors commonly abendon the Mss. on account oi the sup·
posed violation oi metrical requirements3 but see note on mag(ls)
ecfer-tam in 466, and Leo's Plautia. Forscls. p. 251.
