⁵21. Regarded by Karsten as an interpolation.

524. operta . . . aperta aaut: Karsten regards these words as an

’ interpolation.

527. nebit modo Ι intro: with our imperfect knowledge of the
restrictione of hiatus, it is as well to allow it at this unusual place
in the verse as to alter the reading of the Mes. Additional doubt,
however, is caused by the anapaest in the seventh 1001.

532. ineptiae inebriare: Leo (Plautia. Ferret. pp. 224 11.) shows
that final c is much more frequently disregarded in Plautino verse
than hasbeen supposed. After a short vowel, it may not only
be disregarded before an initial consonant of a following word, but
itis often elided also before an initial vowel (see App. 466), as 11
continued to be in classical times. 111 lines like the present one (Leo
cites numerous others, p. 297 1.), 11 may be thatr was similarly elided,
though preceded by a long vowel (justas 11 was elided, without
regard to the length of the preceding vow 1). Leo, however, excludes
such an hypothesis as inadmissible. Possibly we should read 11111111ΐᾶ0
1110101030. .
536. Ibave followed Leo in letting mibi begin this verse. In the ’
Mss. it ends the preceding line, where it cannot possibly stand.

541. See App. 152. There can be no doubt tbat thesubjunctiveis
frequently used in Latin 10 express the idea 01 obligatior or propriety,
where the only correct translation is made by the use of should, cuybt

to, or some equivalent expression; see 0011011 11111111 Classical

54⁷. It is not necessary to make any emendation here. See note.
To change bic to ictio destroys the alliteration, which seems intentional.
550. epotetur: it seems 10 me that editors have changed this to

impacatior without sufficient reason. We know next to nothing about
the usage 01 either 01 these words, and in the iace 01 such ignorance
it is wiser to let the reading 01 the Mss. stand. The fact that
spato occurs once in Plautus aud once in Ovid in an active 101111 10
hardly sufficient evidence 101 reiecting spectatur here as a collateral
deponent form. Verbs which are found in both active and deponent
forms, even in the same author, are common 3 see, for instance, diction-
aries under proficiscor, proficiam ; amplector, amplexo ‚· sortior, sertio ;
comitor, comito; and many others (see Introd. 589). The interpre-
