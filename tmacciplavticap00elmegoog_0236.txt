tation in my notes was suggested by Fay (Classical Reoiew for 1894, p.
391), who, however, accepts insputatur as a prohable correction. He

¹ extends his interpretation to insputarier and insputari in 553 and 555.

Iu this he may be correct, but his objection to the transitive use
of imputo, though serious, is not insurmountable. Other similar
compounds are found with the accusative, eg. inclamo, iauoco (liter-
ally, to call upon or ot). ⁶

5⁵8. Commonly considered corrupt, but see my note. Leo retains
epo, hut indicates an impossible scansion.

597. The Mss. read atra pic. Havet (Reoue de Philolopie‚ 18. p.
242) argues ior atra opiter pis.

65³. This line is commonly considered corrupt, but see my note.
On the use of -ae in the sense of aero, indeed, see Warren, Am. Jour.
os Pla. 11. pp. 50 ff.

694. Apparently corrupt. The line can be read metrioallyas it
stands only by scanning interdico, which seems impossible.

699. This line may have originally ended in redae, the bene est then
belonging to the beginning of the next line; see Speijer in Mnemosyne
(1888), p. 152, and cf. 686, 923, and Prol. 43.

⁷49. The readingpi the Mss. is retained. See my note.

X. p. 427.

791. For the procl that the Romans felt a distinct and important
difference between the perfect and present tenses in expressione refer·
ring to the future, see Cornell Stadios in Classical Philolopa Vl.

eoo-802. See Karsten (la).

818-822. Regarded by Karsten as an interpolation.

819, Editors commonly read dupla instead of duplam, and inter·
pret the line as meaning eobo haee lambe killed and iiten offer lomb sor
sale ot double tlte price (ie. at double the price it is really worth).

This interpretation is open to the following objections : -

(1) Lonii means bamberc, ie. those who with their own hands
sleughter animals; but the interpretation in question makes it neces-
sary to suppose that the hutchers employed some one else to do their
hutchering.

(2) The positione of locant and danunt clearly show that these
two words are strongly contrasted. The interpretation in question
disregarde this contrast altogether.

(3) Thereisno authority of any kind forthe readingdaplc. The
manuscript authority is unanimously in favor oi duplam, and such
