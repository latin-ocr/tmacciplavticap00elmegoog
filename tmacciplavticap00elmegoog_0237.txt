authority ought always to bc respected until it has been clearly
proved to be impossible. Furthermcre, the presence 01 duplam in
the Mes. would be difficolt to account ior, 11 we suppose that dupio
was originally written, as duplam Is the difficilior lectic,· it would
never have occurred to a scribe to write duplam cyniram, double
lamb, if he had found duple in hle Ms, since dupla and duplam were
used 01 price commonly enough to have occasioned no difficulty.

(4) Finally, the parasite is complaining about the quality 01
things, not about the price ς note, ior instance, foetidos (813), petroni
(820). The price 01 iood never worries a parasite. .

The interpretation offered ln my notes avoids all 01 these difficulties
Apnos is the object 01 locant, just aestatuum is, In locant 0000000010-
adendam ,· the only diderence is that the lembs are contracted ior as fit
to be sleapbtered ‚· the statue as one to be 10000. In neither case does
locant imply that anytbing already in one’s possession Isto be baaded
ouer to some one else3 it implies, in either case, merely a contract ior
something not yet in one’s possession. The locator, as Hallidie says,
may be either the party who pays, or the party who is pata, according
to the nature 01 tbe contract. In the present passage the luait' are the
parties to be pald (by the public, with the understanding that the lamb
is to be young aud tender). For another instance 01 caedundus in the
sense of Jit to be killed, sat, see Aul. 561. ’

Studien, II. p. 80), conjectures alter before semenator,- see my note.

8³0. Bothe’s conjecture oi bic est? ecquis afterecqut‘s is commonly
adopted, but it seems to me too uncertain to justity incorporating it
into the text. ’

836. Abraham (Stadia Plautina, Jahrbnecber fair Closs. Phil. ior
1885, p. 202) holds thatin ternpore is not Plautino Latin.

840. The Mss. end this line with noli irascier, which both destroys
the metra and is inappropriate. Probably these words have crept ln
irem 845, displacing what originally stood here.
