882. iam dia: Gray (Procoedinys os 11ιο Cambridge Phil. Soc.
101 1888, p. 6) revives Wagner's emendation, tom modo.

892. Eris-Niemcyer takes etiam with quom in the sense 01 soen
when. Kirlr (Am. Jour, os Phil. XVIII. p. 26) takes itin the sense
01 still. But its position iavcrs my interpretatmn. It Plautus did
not intend etiam to be taken with sancte, he would be guilty 01 nn·
necessary ambiguity in assigning it to this position in the sentence.

901. Ihave followed the Mss. in making a new scene here, though
editors commonly follow Spengel (Scenents'tel, pp. 278 ff.) in recog·
nizing no division.

928. reducem: on the derivation and torm of this word, see
Fleckeisen, Neue Johrhiiclter ior 1893, p. 196 i. audior 1895, p. 0171.
ln the present passage it is customary to write redducam, hut thIs is
against all manuscript authority, and against the uniform usage oi all
poets from Naevius on, including Plautus himself (ci, in the present
play, 437, 686, 931; also Prol. 43). In aaa 909 there is similarly
no authority 101 redducam, though editors adopt this reading. The
simplest way 10 remedy the mette is to assume, with FleckeIsen, that
te belongs 01101 tao.

927. hoec. . . repertast: probably 00 has fallen ont before the 10
01 repertast.

964. Perhaps Plautus wrote istaec (Schmidt) instead 01 101ος or
oc die (Camerarius) instead 01 dis. ⁰

1022-1023. One ci these lines is commonly rejected, hut, it seems
10 me, without adequate reason. See my note.
