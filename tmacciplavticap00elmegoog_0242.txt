N this book the essential facts of Latin Grammar are pre·
sented within the smallest compass consistent with high
scholarly standards. lt covers not only the work of the pre·
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntectical usages
found only in ante-classical or post-classical Latin, and by disre-
garding all questions that are purely theoretical or historiast, it
hasbeen found possible to treat the subject with entire adequacy
in the compass of ²50 peges exclusive of lndexes. ln the Ger·
man schools‚ books of this scope fully meet the exacting demands
of the entire gymnasial course, and the host of teachers who have
tried Bennett's Grammar find that they are materially helped by
the absence of the mass of useless and irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars. “ ’
